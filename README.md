# Modern Applications of Numerical Linear Algebra Methods

This is the collection of course materials for the GIAN Course
_Modern Applications of Numerical Linear Algebra Methods_.

The course is scheduled from _June 26, 2016_ to _July 5, 2016_ at IIT Indore.

* [Indian Institute of Technology, Indore](http://www.iiti.ac.in/)


The course consists of three modules:

* Module A - Short Julia Course
* Module B - Eigenvalue and Singular Value Decompositions
* Module C - Applications

The course is presented through twenty  one-hour lectures and ten two-hour tutorials.

Course materials are using [Julia](http://julialang.org/) programming language
and are presented as [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
The naming scheme of the notebooks is the following:

* lectures start with `L`,
* tutorial assignments start with `T`, and
* solutions to tutorial assignments start with`S`.

PDF files for the three modules are also provided.

To understand the author's concepts behind the creation of the course,
read the [Manifest](src/Manifest.md).

The notebooks can be used in three ways:

1. Browsing the notebooks with
[IPython notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) ->
[browse the notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/github.com/ivanslapnicar/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course/tree/master/src/)

2. Cloning the notebooks to your computer with the command (in Linux)

    `git clone https://github.com/ivanslapnicar/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course`

    For Windows, you can install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
    and use it to clone the repository.

    The notebooks are now located in the directory `GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course/src/` and can
be used interactively (you need to install  [Julia](http://julialang.org/) and
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) as described in the notebook
[L00 Installing and Running Julia](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/github.com/ivanslapnicar/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course/tree/master/src/Module A - Short Julia Course/L00 Installing and Running Julia.ipynb)).
PDF files are in the directory `src/pdf`.

3. Executing the notebooks on [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.org/):
  * go to https://juliabox.org and sign in
  * go to __Sync__
  * paste the address `https://github.com/ivanslapnicar/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course` into
    __Git Clone URL__ box
  * check that the __Branch__ is set to _master_
  * check that  __JuliaBox Folder__ is set to _GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course_
  * press _+_ to add the repository
  * press down arrow to synchronize the repository
  * go to  __IJulia__

    The directory `GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course` is now listed. The notebooks are located in
the dircetory `src/`.
